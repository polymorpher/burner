    event Burned(address indexed user, address indexed asset, address indexed stablecoin, uint256 burnedAmount, uint256 stablecoinAmount);
    uint256 constant PRECISION_FACTOR = 1e18;

    uint256 public minRate; // minimum "exchange rate" the user would get in this round in number of units of stablecoins, for burning some amount of ERC20 tokens that had a market-value of 1.0 USD(T) per unit of token prior to the hack. The value is multiplied by `PRECISION_FACTOR` to accommodate for fractions. For example, if a user holds 1.0 USDC and the current mechanism allows the user to at least get 0.1 (new) stablecoin, the value of `minRate` should therefore be set to 0.1 * `PRECISION_FACTOR` = 1e17
    uint256 public maxRate; // similar to `minRate`, but represents the maximum number of units of stablecoins the user would get in this round
    uint256 public baseRate; // the current base exchange rate, without any bonus based on elapsed time since the last exchange

    uint256 public lastResetTimestamp; // when the last exchange occurred

    address public stablecoin; // the contract address of the new stablecoin which the user would get. The intended value is USDS (at address 0x471f66F75af9238A2FA23bA23862B5957109fB21). Here in comments, we use "new stablecoin" and stablecoin interchangeably most of the time. Sometimes we also use the term referring to some depegged tokens which used to be stablecoins before the hack, but we would explicitly state so and clarify.
    address public stablecoinHolder; // the address of the wallet which holds the stablecoin. The address should approve this contract's address up to a sufficient amount, so that this contract can send the stablecoin on behalf of the `stablecoinHolder` wallet to users

    uint256 public resetThresholdAmount; // The number of stablecoins (in fractional-units) cumulatively received by the users to trigger a "reset event". A "reset event" would result in the current exchange rate to be decreased to minRate. When any user burns their ERC20 tokens, they could receive some stablecoins, thereby contribute towards the reset threshold. Note that the current exchange rate linearly decreases proportionally to the ratio of `#stablecoins received by the user / reset threshold` no matter whether the reset threshold is reached. For example, if we want to trigger a reset event at the threshold of 250 USDS (which has 6 decimals), then resetThresholdAmount is 2.5e+8
    uint256 public resetPeriod = 3 hours; // as time elapses after each reset, the exchange rate linearly increases over time, proportional to the ratio of `time elapsed / resetPeriod`

    mapping(address => bool) public allowList; // when `useAllowList` is set to true, only addresses in allowList would be able to burn permitted ERC20 tokens and exchange for stablecoins
    bool public useAllowList = false;

    mapping(address => uint256) tokenValueRate; // Each key is the address of a permitted ERC20 token. The key's corresponding value is how many units of the ERC20 token is equivalent to 1 unit of the stablecoin in market-value, multiplied by `PRECISION_FACTOR`. Here, a unit is referring to the "whole unit" of the token, not the "fractional unit", i.e. in terms of wei. For example, a unit of 1USDC (0x985458E523dB3d53125813eD68c274899e9DfAb4) is 1000000 (1e+6) "fractional units" of 1USDC. Since 1USDC used to be a stablecoin itself, the key should be 0x985458E523dB3d53125813eD68c274899e9DfAb4 and the value should be 1e18 (exactly `PRECISION_FACTOR`). On the other hand, a unit of 1WBTC (0x3095c7557bCb296ccc6e363DE01b760bA031F2d9) is 1e+8 "fractional units" of 1WBTC, and is worth roughly 21502 USDT at the time of the hack, therefore the key-value pair should be (0x3095c7557bCb296ccc6e363DE01b760bA031F2d9, 2.1502e+22)
